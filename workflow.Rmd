# Workflow

## Prediction

1. feature engineering
  - Prepare the data for modelling
    - Transform variables to the appropriate units of analysis.  
        -This process may look like:           
             *  Normalize and center variables.  
             *  Create new variables or features of your dataset.  
             *  Decide how to handle missing data or zeroes. Consider "filling in the blanks" with imputation.           
   - Use resampling methods to tune hyperparmeters.
      - Compare & contrast performance metrics of multiple models.

5. predictions



## Inference

1. Clean data
2. Specify model
3. Fit model
4. Check that model fitting process converged / worked
5. Check statistical assumptions of model


KEY part that always gets left out: working with multiple modellings
